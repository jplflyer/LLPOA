Use this directory for the web design. Joe will move as necessary once it is done.

# Comments
I'm not terribly concerned what tools you use, but I do not want a single thing that is Windows-specific. I develop on Mac and will deploy to a Ubuntu instance.

I'm fine with NPM and other tools.

# Documentation I Want
I would like you to update this file with directions on how to view or update the instance. If I need to npm install or anything like that, please document that.

Please also list any tools or technologies you directly use so I have a list. If it's not entirely clear, please make sure I know how to find them on the web. If it's part of the NPM install, I can figure it out.

I also would like professional-level documentation that ensures I can take over once you're done. This includes comments in the CSS that tells me what the various elements are for, and if you have anything tricky, you may need more.

JavaScript and HTML should be clean.

When we're done, I'll go through things, and if I have questions, I would want you to answer them. I don't want you to provide a training class, but enough information that I know where to go look for what I need to learn.

# Pages Desired
From the original request on RentACoder:

- Home page with a carousel-based image
- A links page.
- A blog page (letter from the president sort of thing)
- A blog entry page with an embedded HTML editor. You do NOT need to implement the server side. I just want the page.

The idea is that I can run with it for the dozen or so total pages I really need.

# The Original RFP
This is what I posted to RentACoder (with a tiny edit changing reactive to responsive):

I am building a website for a Lake Property Owners Association in Minnesota. The association members are people who own property surrounding a particular lake, and the site is for sharing information about the lake and surrounding area.

I am a professional coder, but most of my work is server-side coding (Java, C++, etc). I'm a terrible designer and barely adequate with modern JavaScript.

I need someone who can do the site design. I will give you a small number of photographs to incorporate into the design. I want a lakes / nature scene theme with a clean and uncomplicated design that I can then expand. Requirements:

- Responsive. That is, works well with both mobile and desktop.
- You're producing HTML5, CSS, and JS. I'm not interested in someone who is going to give me a photoshop file and expect me to figure out how to make that work.
- I am perfectly fine if you use an existing theme from somewhere, but when done, it should be a unique look.
- I prefer to limit the number of JS tools. I like bootstrap, but could be talked into a different framework with little effort.
- For deliverables, I want four pages:
  - Home page with a carousel-based image
  - A links page.
  - A blog page (letter from the president sort of thing)
  - A blog entry page with an embedded HTML editor. You do NOT need to implement the server side. I just want the page.

As an old professional developer, I have high standards for delivered files. I would good, clean code. Because I'm not an expert in all of this, I want embedded comments and any other documentation required to take your design and expand it. I'll be adding several more pages including a photo library and I don't know what else.

I do not require fancy user input. I want the club secretary to be able to upload her newsletters, the club president to upload blog posts, and members to manage the photo library, but these can be pretty simple. We don't need to throw Angular or ReactJS into all this. I can implement these pages once you give me the tools to do so.

Server-side, I intend to embed this into a Ruby on Rails project. If you're already a RoR programmer and want to start there, that's great, but not necessary. What is important is that I can take your design and run with it.
